* initial release, see
https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=C4217F2ABFA5D44BA8F3DCD899E5B0C8E42ED96EA7%40EXCH-MBX-F.ulaval.ca&amp;forum_name=denovoassembler-users

== 0.0.4 (12 tickets) ==

* Fixed many bugs in Ray when k is lower than 25 (when k=21, in particular)
(trac #88)
* Fixed segmentation fault when loading helicos data (trac #86)
* Made some changes after analyzing how the word length is impacting the
assembly of the public dataset SRA001125 (trac #81)
* Modified the Parallel_Ray_Engine (now version 0.0.4) to handle mixed
datasets (tested on the public dataset SRA003611) (trac #79)
* Implemented a dead-end detector for unpaired short reads (trac #20)
* Fixed segmentation fault when no input is provided (trac #82)
* Changed Ray's default behavior when no peak is observed in the coverage
(trac #80)
* Added public dataset links on the web page (trac #77)
* Fixed a serious flaw in Parallel_Ray_Engine that led to segmentation faults
(trac #76) (this flaw was kindly reported by Dr Torsten Seemann @  Victorian
 Bioinformatics Consortium -- thank you!)
* Changed the behavior of memory allocators in message passing --
   Ray now reuses allocated memory for ingoing and outgoing messages
   (10 MB for each).
* Added a mummer validation script (r3090)

== 0.0.5 (8 tickets) ==

* Ray now outputs assemblies in AMOS format (with -a), (trac #58)
* Ray commands can be provided with a commands file (like in 0.0.3 and 0.0.4)
as well as with command-line arguments, (trac #94) and
* Ray removes non-A-T-C-G letters at both ends of reads.

== 0.0.6 (22 tickets) ==

* 'make test' now performs unit tests (trac #83)
* 'make simtools' compiles simulation tools (trac #43)
* ignore coverage at 255 or more in the coverage distribution (trac #105)
* reduced number of contigs and error rates (trac #103 #106 #107 #110 #111
#118)
* MPI messages are grouped together in up-to-4096-bytes messages, when
possible (trac #114)
* unroll some loops to gain performance (trac #117)
* scripts included to do benchmarks
* improved AMOS file generation
* corrected the loader for color-space reads (thanks to sparks from
seqanswers.com)
* some code refactoring to reduce the size of Machine.cpp
* Comparison with other assemblers 


== 0.0.7 (25 tickets) ==
 
 * (Small) speed improvement in seed extension (trac #21)
 * Ray can now write to user-specified files -- Huge thanks to Matthew
 MacManes (University of California -- Berkeley) for suggesting this (trac #163)
 * Changed the allocator size to 0x1000000 (trac #162)
 * Ray can now estimate paired distances -- thanks to Torsten
 Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash
 University, AUSTRALIA) for his expertise (trac #159 158 #156 #131)
 * Each MPI process now has a forest of 0x1000 splay trees, which are frozen
 (no more splay operations) after no more items are inserted. (trac #151 #150
 #149)
 * Added running times in comparisons, as wisely suggested by Matthew MacManes
 (University of California -- Berkeley) (trac #136)
 * Ray is now better with a large peak coverage, and is more careful
 otherwise. (trac #135 #134)
 * Some improvements on mix datasets (trac #132)
 * Ray is now robust when parsing arguments, and will complaint if something
 is messy -- thanks to Torsten Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash 
 University, AUSTRALIA) for noticing the issue (trac #129)</text>

* Changed the allocator size to 0x1000000 (trac #162)
* Ray can now estimate paired distances -- thanks to Torsten
Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash
University, AUSTRALIA) for his expertise (trac #159 158 #156 #131)
* Each MPI process now has a forest of 0x1000 splay trees, which are frozen
(no more splay operations) after no more items are inserted. (trac #151 #150
#149)
* Added running times in comparisons, as wisely suggested by Matthew MacManes
(University of California -- Berkeley) (trac #136)
* Ray is now better with a large peak coverage, and is more careful
otherwise. (trac #135 #134)
* Some improvements on mix datasets (trac #132)
* Ray is now robust when parsing arguments, and will complaint if something
is messy -- thanks to Torsten Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash 
University, AUSTRALIA) for noticing the issue (trac #129)</text>

see [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=C4217F2ABFA5D44BA8F3DCD899E5B0C8E42ED96EA7%40EXCH-MBX-F.ulaval.ca&amp;forum_name=denovoassembler-users mailing list]

== 0.0.4 (12 tickets) ==

* Fixed many bugs in Ray when k is lower than 25 (when k=21, in particular)
(trac #88)
* Fixed segmentation fault when loading helicos data (trac #86)
* Made some changes after analyzing how the word length is impacting the
assembly of the public dataset SRA001125 (trac #81)
* Modified the Parallel_Ray_Engine (now version 0.0.4) to handle mixed
datasets (tested on the public dataset SRA003611) (trac #79)
* Implemented a dead-end detector for unpaired short reads (trac #20)
* Fixed segmentation fault when no input is provided (trac #82)
* Changed Ray's default behavior when no peak is observed in the coverage
(trac #80)
* Added public dataset links on the web page (trac #77)
* Fixed a serious flaw in Parallel_Ray_Engine that led to segmentation faults
(trac #76) (this flaw was kindly reported by Dr Torsten Seemann @  Victorian
Bioinformatics Consortium -- thank you!)
* Changed the behavior of memory allocators in message passing --
Ray now reuses allocated memory for ingoing and outgoing messages
(10 MB for each).
* Added a mummer validation script (r3090)

== 0.0.5 (8 tickets) ==

* Ray now outputs assemblies in AMOS format (with -a), (trac #58)
* Ray commands can be provided with a commands file (like in 0.0.3 and 0.0.4)
as well as with command-line arguments, (trac #94) and
* Ray removes non-A-T-C-G letters at both ends of reads.

== 0.0.6 (22 tickets) ==

* 'make test' now performs unit tests (trac #83)
* 'make simtools' compiles simulation tools (trac #43)
* ignore coverage at 255 or more in the coverage distribution (trac #105)
* reduced number of contigs and error rates (trac #103 #106 #107 #110 #111
#118)
* MPI messages are grouped together in up-to-4096-bytes messages, when
possible (trac #114)
* unroll some loops to gain performance (trac #117)
* scripts included to do benchmarks
* improved AMOS file generation
* corrected the loader for color-space reads (thanks to sparks from
seqanswers.com)
* some code refactoring to reduce the size of Machine.cpp
* Comparison with other assemblers 


== 0.0.7 (25 tickets) ==

* (Small) speed improvement in seed extension (trac #21)

* 'make test' now performs unit tests (trac #83)
* 'make simtools' compiles simulation tools (trac #43)
* ignore coverage at 255 or more in the coverage distribution (trac #105)
* reduced number of contigs and error rates (trac #103 #106 #107 #110 #111
#118)
* MPI messages are grouped together in up-to-4096-bytes messages, when
possible (trac #114)
* unroll some loops to gain performance (trac #117)
* scripts included to do benchmarks
* improved AMOS file generation
* corrected the loader for color-space reads (thanks to sparks from
seqanswers.com)
* some code refactoring to reduce the size of Machine.cpp
* Comparison with other assemblers

* (Small) speed improvement in seed extension (trac #21)
* Ray can now write to user-specified files -- Huge thanks to Matthew
MacManes (University of California -- Berkeley) for suggesting this (trac #163)
* Changed the allocator size to 0x1000000 (trac #162)
* Ray can now estimate paired distances -- thanks to Torsten
Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash
University, AUSTRALIA) for his expertise (trac #159 158 #156 #131)
* Each MPI process now has a forest of 0x1000 splay trees, which are frozen
(no more splay operations) after no more items are inserted. (trac #151 #150 #149)
* Added running times in comparisons, as wisely suggested by Matthew MacManes
(University of California -- Berkeley) (trac #136)
* Ray is now better with a large peak coverage, and is more careful
otherwise. (trac #135 #134)
* Some improvements on mix datasets (trac #132)
* Ray is now robust when parsing arguments, and will complaint if something
is messy -- thanks to Torsten Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash 
University, AUSTRALIA) for noticing the issue (trac #129)</text>

DNA assembly is now a challenge because of the overwhelming amount of data produced by sequencing facilities. 454 De Novo Assembler is an assembler to perform De Novo assembly with new sequencing technologies (i.g. Titanium).

It takes fastq files and generates an assembly. You can use flower to convert sff files to fastq files. In theory, 454 De Novo Assembler can assemble reads from any technology as long as the quality is provided. The algorithm contructs De Bruijn graphs. The word length can be up to 32 nucleotides.

DNA assembly is now a challenge because of the overwhelming amount of data produced by sequencing facilities. 454 De Novo Assembler is an assembler to perform De Novo assembly with [http://seqanswers.com/ new sequencing technologies] (i.g. [http://454.com/ Titanium]).

It takes [http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/FASTQ_sequence_format fastq] files and generates an assembly. You can [http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2008/11/14/454-sequencing-and-parsing-the-sff-binary-format use flower to convert sff files to fastq files]. In theory, 454 De Novo Assembler can assemble reads from any technology as long as the quality is provided. The algorithm contructs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph de Bruijn graphs]. The word length can be up to 31 nucleotides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">DNA assembly is now a challenge because of the overwhelming amount of data produced by sequencing facilities. De Novo Assembler (dna) is an assembler that performs De Novo assembly with [http://seqanswers.com/ new sequencing technologies] (i.g. [http://454.com/ 454 FLX, 454 Titanium], [http://illumina.com Solexa]).

== How it works? ==

It takes [http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/FASTQ_sequence_format fastq] files or fasta files and generates an assembly. For 454 data, you can [http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2008/11/14/454-sequencing-and-parsing-the-sff-binary-format use flower to convert sff files to fastq files]. In theory,  De Novo Assembler can assemble reads from any technology as long as the data can be converted to the fasta format or the [http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/FASTQ_sequence_format fastq] format. The algorithm contructs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph de Bruijn graphs]. The word length can be up to 31 nucleotides.

== How to use it ==

With GNU/Linux, download the source, compile it, and use it.
 svn export http://denovoassembler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/denovoassembler/tags/MAGIC-ASSEMBLER-20090105-2
 cd MAGIC-ASSEMBLER-20090105-2
 bash script/build.sh
 ./build/bin/dna -assemblyDirectory Assembly -useCache no -wordSize 25 -minimumCoverage 3 -windowSize 2 -minimumContigSize 500 *.fasta

== Options ==
 -assemblyDirectory   default: Assembly
                      description: the directory where files will be written.
 -useCache            default: no
                      description: use the graph file from a previous assembly in &lt;assemblyDirectory&gt;, if any.
 -wordSize            default: 25 (maximum: 31)
                      description: the length of strings inside vertices, edges will be defined for words of length &lt;wordSize&gt;+1.
 -minimumCoverage     default: 3
                      description: the number of occurances of a word needed to make it solid.
 -minimumContigSize   default: 500
                      description: the minimum length of contigs generated with the graph.
 -windowSize          default: 2
                      description: the window size to assess the quality of paths in the graph, it is the number of edges to be checked.
                                   note that the algorithm removes tips, bubbles, and includes an optimization that 
                                   automatically increases the cutoff to eliminate incorrect edges.


== Downloads ==

The assembler itself is currently a work in progress. Nonetheless, you can download the source [http://denovoassembler.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/denovoassembler/tags/MAGIC-ASSEMBLER-20090105-2.tar.gz?view=tar here]. Note that [http://denovoassembler.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/denovoassembler/tags/MAGIC-ASSEMBLER-20090105-2.tar.gz?view=tar MAGIC-ASSEMBLER-20090105-2.tar.gz] is a snapshot and may not yet be suitable for production.

Alternatively, you can fetch the trunk.
 svn co https://denovoassembler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/denovoassembler/trunk

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;OpenAssembler&lt;/b&gt; assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process. 

=== Manuscript ===

We submitted a manuscript on 15 October 2009. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

== Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn assembly with mixed technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;Ray&lt;/b&gt; is a parallel version utilizing MPI. The code is very different because of the heavy communication between MPI processes.

Our team started developing Ray on 2010-01-21 10:41:09 -0500. 

=== Features ===

Ray

* is massively parallel,
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random,
* supports paired-end reads,
* does not write pesky intermediate large binary files,
* runs on one and more MPI processes.

=== Note on MPI implementation === 

It currently works well with [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI]. 

You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a face condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray sequences.fasta 

It does not work with MPICH2. We think that this failure is putative to a bug in MPICH2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;OpenAssembler&lt;/b&gt; assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process. 

=== Manuscript ===

We submitted a manuscript on 15 October 2009. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

== Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn assembly with mixed technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;Ray&lt;/b&gt; is a parallel version utilizing MPI. The code is very different because of the heavy communication between MPI processes.

Our team started developing Ray on 2010-01-21 10:41:09 -0500. 

=== Features ===

Ray

* is massively parallel,
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random,
* supports paired-end reads,
* does not write pesky intermediate large binary files,
* is licensed with the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3],
* is implemented in c++,
* distributes computations across MPI processes,
* distributes data across MPI processes,
* is tested with Open-MPI,
* uses bit shifts and other optimizations,
* supports a vertex size up to 31,
* uses splay trees, and
* runs on one and more MPI processes.

=== Note on MPI implementation === 

It currently works well with [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI]. 

You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray sequences.fasta 

It does not work with MPICH2. We think that this failure is putative to a bug in MPICH2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;OpenAssembler&lt;/b&gt; assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process. 

=== Manuscript ===

We submitted a manuscript on 15 October 2009. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

== Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn genome assembly with mixed technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;Ray&lt;/b&gt; is a parallel version utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. The code is very different because of the heavy communication between MPI processes.

Our team started developing Ray on 2010-01-21 10:41:09 -0500. 

=== Features ===

Ray

* is massively parallel,
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random,
* supports paired-end reads,
* does not write pesky intermediate large binary files,
* is licensed with the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3],
* is implemented in c++,
* distributes computations across MPI processes,
* distributes data across MPI processes,
* is tested with [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI],
* runs on [http://www.linux.com/ GNU/Linux],
* uses bit shifts and other optimizations,
* supports a vertex size up to 31,
* uses splay trees, and
* runs on one and more MPI processes.

=== Running Ray with Sun Grid Engine (with qsub)===

 see HumanChromosome1-qsub.sh

=== Limitations ===

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
Ray is distributed with the GPLv3 license (see gpl-3.txt).

=== Note on MPI implementation ===

It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray sequences.fasta

=== Limitations ===

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
Ray is distributed with the GPLv3 license (see gpl-3.txt).

=== Note on MPI implementation ===

It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray sequences.fasta

Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology.

== Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn genome assembly with mixed technologies ==

&lt;b&gt;Ray&lt;/b&gt; is a parallel version utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. The code is very different because of the heavy communication between MPI processes.

Our team started developing Ray on 2010-01-21 10:41:09 -0500. 

=== Description ===

Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++. It is tested with OpenMPI and g++ on Linux 2.6.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk.

=== Features ===

Ray

* is massively parallel,
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random,
* supports paired-end reads,
* does not write pesky intermediate large binary files,
* is licensed with the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3],
* is implemented in c++,
* distributes computation across MPI processes,
* distributes data across MPI processes,
* is tested with [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI],
* runs on [http://www.linux.com/ GNU/Linux],
* uses bit shifts and other optimizations,
* supports a vertex size up to 31,
* uses splay trees, and
* runs on one and more MPI processes.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++. It is tested with OpenMPI and g++ on Linux 2.6.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk.

== Features ==

Ray

* is massively parallel,
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random,
* supports paired-end reads,
* does not write pesky intermediate large binary files,
* is licensed with the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3],
* is implemented in c++,
* distributes computation across MPI processes,
* distributes data across MPI processes,
* is tested with [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI],
* runs on [http://www.linux.com/ GNU/Linux],
* uses bit shifts and other optimizations,
* supports a vertex size up to 31,
* uses splay trees, and
* runs on one and more MPI processes.

 http://denovoassembler.sf.net/, 2010.

== Installation ==

=== Download Ray! ===

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download Ray] (version 0.0.3 will be available around 10 March 2010)

=== Compilation ===

 tar -xjf Ray-0.0.3.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-0.0.3
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

=== Example of input files === 

RayInputTemplate.txt

=== Examples of commands ===

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt input.txt  # 1 cpu only

 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt input.txt  # quad-core

 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt input.txt  # 1024 cpu

== Community ==

* Mailing list: denovoassembler-users &lt;AT&gt; lists &lt;DOT&gt; sourceforge &lt;DOT&gt; net ([http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=denovoassembler-users archives])

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.

It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray sequences.fasta



= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

&lt;b&gt;OpenAssembler&lt;/b&gt; assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

== Running Ray ==

You must use mpirun:

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1 cpu only
 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # quad-core
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1024 cpu

Basically, Ray understands two commands in RayInputTemplate.txt:

 LoadSingleEndReads &lt;sequencesFile&gt;

and

 LoadPairedEndReads &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;fragmentLengthStandardDeviation&gt;

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes their read lengths. Ray supports fasta, fastq, and sff formats. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Examples:

 LoadSingleEndReads 1.fasta
 LoadSingleEndReads 2.fastq
 LoadSingleEndReads UIJD.sff
 LoadPairedEndReads 908_1.fastq 908_fastq 215 30
 LoadPairedEndReads large_l.fasta large_r.fasta 2000 200


Ray writes contigs to Contigs.fasta.

non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
It currently works well with Open-MPI.

 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

You must use mpirun:

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1 cpu only
 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # quad-core
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1024 cpu

Basically, Ray understands two commands in RayInputTemplate.txt:

 LoadSingleEndReads &lt;sequencesFile&gt;

and

 LoadPairedEndReads &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;fragmentLengthStandardDeviation&gt;

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. Ray supports fasta, fastq, and sff formats. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Examples:

 LoadSingleEndReads 1.fasta
 LoadSingleEndReads 2.fastq
 LoadSingleEndReads UIJD.sff
 LoadPairedEndReads 908_1.fastq 908_fastq 215 30
 LoadPairedEndReads large_l.fasta large_r.fasta 2000 200


Ray writes contigs to Contigs.fasta.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray template.ray

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with LoadSingleEndReads)
* paired-end reads (with LoadPairedEndReads)

== Other features ==

* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray template.ray

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with LoadSingleEndReads)
* paired-end reads (with LoadPairedEndReads)

== Other features ==

* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes

== How to cite us?==

 http://denovoassembler.sf.net/, 2010.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* make
* g++
* openmpi (1.3.4 or 1.4.1)
* sequence data ;)
* Any GNU/Linux flavor will do.

=== Tested platforms ===

* Fedora
* CentOS
* Ubuntu

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download]

 tar -xjf Ray-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

You must use mpirun:

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1 cpu only
 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # quad-core
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1024 cpu

Basically, Ray understands two commands in RayInputTemplate.txt:

 LoadSingleEndReads &lt;sequencesFile&gt;

and

 LoadPairedEndReads &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;fragmentLengthStandardDeviation&gt;

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. Ray supports fasta, fastq, and sff formats. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Ray writes contigs to Contigs.fasta.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with LoadSingleEndReads)
* paired-end reads (with LoadPairedEndReads)

== Other features ==

* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes

== How to cite us?==

 http://denovoassembler.sf.net/, 2010.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* make
* g++
* openmpi (1.3.4 or 1.4.1)
* sequence data ;)
* Any GNU/Linux flavor will do.

=== Tested platforms ===

* Fedora
* CentOS
* Ubuntu

=== License ===

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download]

 tar -xjf Ray-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

You must use mpirun:

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1 cpu only
 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # quad-core
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1024 cpu

Basically, Ray understands two commands in RayInputTemplate.txt:

 LoadSingleEndReads &lt;sequencesFile&gt;

and

 LoadPairedEndReads &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;fragmentLengthStandardDeviation&gt;

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. Ray supports fasta, fastq, and sff formats. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Ray writes contigs to Contigs.fasta.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray template.ray

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm ./Ray template.ray

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with LoadSingleEndReads)
* paired-end reads (with LoadPairedEndReads)

== Other features ==

* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes

== How to cite us?==

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* make
* g++
* openmpi (1.3.4 or 1.4.1)
* sequence data ;)
* Any GNU/Linux flavor will do.

=== Tested platforms ===

* Fedora
* CentOS
* Ubuntu

=== License ===

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download]

 tar -xjf Ray-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

You must use mpirun:

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1 cpu only
 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # quad-core
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1024 cpu

Basically, Ray understands two commands in RayInputTemplate.txt:

 LoadSingleEndReads &lt;sequencesFile&gt;

and

 LoadPairedEndReads &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;fragmentLengthStandardDeviation&gt;

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. Ray supports fasta, fastq, and sff formats. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Ray writes contigs to Contigs.fasta.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpi as it is a pure parallel program with no
non-parallel steps. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu.
It currently works well with Open-MPI.
You may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition, you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with LoadSingleEndReads)
* paired-end reads (with LoadPairedEndReads)

== Other features ==

* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* make
* g++
* openmpi (1.3.4 or 1.4.1)
* sequence data ;)
* Any GNU/Linux flavor will do.

=== Tested platforms ===

* Fedora
* CentOS
* Ubuntu

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download]

 tar -xjf Ray-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

You must use mpirun:

 mpirun -np 1 -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1 cpu only
 mpirun -np 4  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # quad-core
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile RayMachinesFile.txt Ray RayInputTemplate.txt  # 1024 cpu

Basically, Ray understands two commands in RayInputTemplate.txt:

 LoadSingleEndReads &lt;sequencesFile&gt;

and

 LoadPairedEndReads &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;fragmentLengthStandardDeviation&gt;

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. Ray supports fasta, fastq, and sff formats. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Ray writes contigs to Contigs.fasta.

=== Compilation ===


[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download] Ray

 tar -xjf Ray-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

Basically, Ray understands these commands:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt;
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt;
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;.fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with LoadSingleEndReads)
* paired-end reads (with LoadPairedEndReads)

We have a paper about Ray under review.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

=== Tested platforms ===

* [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
* [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS]
* [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

=== Compilation ===


[http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/ Download] Ray

 tar -xjf Ray-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-&lt;version&gt;
 make

To use an alternative mpic++ executable:

 make MPICC=/home/boiseb01/software/ompi-1.4.1-gcc/bin/mpic++

== Running Ray ==

Basically, Ray understands these commands:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt;
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt;
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths. But beware!, if your sff file contains paired-end reads, you must first extract the information, and tell Ray to use them with LoadPairedEndReads.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile


* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile


* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile


* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;.fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with -s)
* paired-end reads (with -p)

== Key features ==

* [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Message_Types AMOS output] for assembly viewers such as [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Hawkeye Hawkeye] &amp; [http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/ Tablet] (with OutputAmosFile)
* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes
* runs on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand Infiniband] (thanks to [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI])
* computation of average length and standard deviation for paired reads

== Comparisons with other assemblers ==

* [[Comparisons with other assemblers for Ray 0.0.6]]
* [[Comparisons for Ray 0.0.7]]

We have a paper about Ray under review.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

=== Tested platforms ===

* [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
* [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS]
* [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

=== Compilation with mpic++ ===


[https://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2/download Download Ray 0.0.7]

 tar -xjf Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-0.0.7
 make


== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm Ray Commands.Ray

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;.fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with -s)
* paired-end reads (with -p)

== Key features ==

* [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Message_Types AMOS output] for assembly viewers such as [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Hawkeye Hawkeye] &amp; [http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/ Tablet] (with OutputAmosFile)
* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes
* runs on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand Infiniband] (thanks to [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI])
* computation of average length and standard deviation for paired reads

== Comparisons with other assemblers ==

* [[Comparisons with other assemblers for Ray 0.0.6]]
* [[Comparisons for Ray 0.0.7]]

== How to cite us?==

 http://denovoassembler.sf.net/, 2010.

We have a paper about Ray under review.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

=== Tested platforms ===

* [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
* [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS]
* [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

=== Compilation with mpic++ ===


[https://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2/download Download Ray 0.0.7]

 tar -xjf Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-0.0.7
 make


== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk.

We have a paper about Ray under review.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

=== Tested platforms ===

* [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
* [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS]
* [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

=== Compilation with mpic++ ===


[https://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2/download Download Ray 0.0.7]

 tar -xjf Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-0.0.7
 make


== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

 mpirun -np 32 --mca btl ^sm Ray Commands.Ray

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;.fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with -s)
* paired-end reads (with -p)

== Key features ==

* [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Message_Types AMOS output] for assembly viewers such as [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Hawkeye Hawkeye] &amp; [http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/ Tablet] (with OutputAmosFile)
* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes
* runs on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand Infiniband] (thanks to [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI])
* computation of average length and standard deviation for paired reads

== Comparisons with other assemblers ==

* [[Comparisons with other assemblers for Ray 0.0.6]]

We have a paper about Ray under review.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

=== Tested platforms ===

* [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
* [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS]
* [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

=== Compilation with mpic++ ===


[https://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2/download Download Ray 0.0.7]

 tar -xjf Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-0.0.7
 make


== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;.fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with -s)
* paired-end reads (with -p)

== Key features ==

* [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Message_Types AMOS output] for assembly viewers such as [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Hawkeye Hawkeye] &amp; [http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/ Tablet] (with OutputAmosFile)
* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes
* runs on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand Infiniband] (thanks to [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI])
* computation of average length and standard deviation for paired reads

We have a paper about Ray under review.

== Installation ==


=== Requirements ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ make]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ g++]
* [http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI] (1.3.4 or 1.4.1) &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;MPICH2 and MVAPICH are not supported&lt;/span&gt;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra sequence data] ;)

Many available GNU/Linux flavors have packages for these requirements.

=== Tested architectures ===

* x86_64
** [http://intel.com/ Intel](R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5560  @ 2.80GHz
** Quad-Core [http://amd.com/ AMD] Opteron(tm) Processor 8378

=== Tested platforms ===

* [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora]
* [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS]
* [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu]

=== License ===

* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3]

=== Compilation with mpic++ ===


[https://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2/download Download Ray 0.0.7]

 tar -xjf Ray-0.0.7.tar.bz2
 cd Ray-0.0.7
 make


== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray


For help:

 mpirun -np 32 Ray --help

Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

Ray is run with mpirun:

1 cpu only:
 mpirun -np 1 Ray Commands.Ray
quad-core:
 mpirun -np 4 Ray Commands.Ray
1024 cpu (you'll probably use Sun Grid Engine for that):
 mpirun -np 1024  -machinefile mpirun.MachinesFile Ray Commands.Ray

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.

= Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach for genome assembly with mixed technologies =

Ray is a parallel genome assembler utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. 
Ray is a single-executable program (the executable is Ray). Its aim is to assemble sequences on
mpi-enabled computers or clusters.
Ray is implemented in c++.
Only the master rank needs to access the files on disk. 

== Tested technologies ==

* Illumina paired-end reads
* Illumina single-end reads
* Roche 454 reads and Illumina reads together

== Supported file formats ==

* Fasta with qualities (&quot;.fastq&quot;)
* SFF (&quot;.sff&quot;)
* Fasta (&quot;.fasta&quot;)

== Reads ==

* single-end reads (with -s)
* paired-end reads (with -p)

== Key features ==

* [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Message_Types AMOS output] for assembly viewers such as [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Hawkeye Hawkeye] &amp; [http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/ Tablet] (with OutputAmosFile)
* is massively parallel
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random
* is implemented in c++
* distributes computation across MPI processes
* distributes data across MPI processes
* runs on one and more MPI processes
* runs on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand Infiniband] (thanks to [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI])
* computation of average length and standard deviation for paired reads

== Running Ray ==

Ray understands these:

* &lt;b&gt;LoadSingleEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;sequencesFile&gt;
aliases: -s, LoadSingleEndReads, -LoadSingleEndReads, --LoadSingleEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;LoadPairedEndReads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; [ &lt;fragmentLength&gt; &lt;standardDeviation&gt; ]
aliases: -p, LoadPairedEndReads, -LoadPairedEndReads, --LoadPairedEndReads

* &lt;b&gt;OutputFile&lt;/b&gt; &lt;outputFile&gt; (default: Ray-Contigs.fasta)
aliases: -o, OutputFile, -OutputFile, --OutputFile

* &lt;b&gt;OutputAmosFile&lt;/b&gt; [ &lt;amosFile&gt; ] (default: Ray-Contigs.afg)
aliases: -a, OutputAmosFile, -OutputAmosFile, --OutputAmosFile


Ray receives commands with command-line arguments or with a commands file. 

&lt;leftSequencesFile&gt; and &lt;rightSequencesFile&gt; must contain the exact same number of sequences, paired reads must be on reverse strands and face each other, and the &lt;fragmentLength&gt; includes the read lengths.

Ray writes contigs to Ray-Contigs.fasta. Ray also writes Ray-Contigs.afg if the command &quot;OutputAmosFile&quot; is given.

== Limitations ==

Ray can not run without mpirun. However, it is safe and reliable to run it with 1 cpu. 

In Open-MPI, you may have to disable the Byte Transfer Layer called Shared Memory to avoid a race condition in the spinlock of Open-MPI. This problem is presumably due to a processor defective design rather than a defect in Open-MPI. The lock instruction is supposed to lock the bus, so if you encounter the race condition (in general, it hangs), you know something is wrong. The following command disables the btl sm at runtime. In our benchmarks on Human Chromosome 1 with short reads, we found that disabling shared memory was necessary.

= OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies =

OpenAssembler assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process.
