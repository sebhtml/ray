= 1.3.0 =
2011-03-XX

* Vertices with less than 1 of coverage are ignored during the computation of
seeds and during the computation of extensions.
* Computation of library outer distances relies on the virtual communicator.
* Expiry positions are used to toss away reads that are out-of-range
* When only one choice is given during the extension and some reads are
in-range, then the sole choice is picked up.
* Fixed a bug for empty reads.
* A read is not added in the active set if it is marked on a repeated vertex
and its mate was not encountered yet.
* Grouped messages in the extension of seeds.
* Reads marked on repeated vertices are cached during the extension.


= 1.2.4 =
2011-02-23

* Reduced the memory fragmentation in the extension of seeds.
* Implemented a large grid table. It is an hash table in with elements in bins
are ordered by the number of accesses.
* The memory for sequence reads is reused in the extension of seeds.
* Any vertex is stored along its reverse complement.
* The Vertex class was stripped to reduce the memory usage.
* The vertex data is now stored in a separate place to reduce memory usage.
* Removed the call to __Realloc
* Don't index reads on vertices with a coverage of 1.
* Structures can be packed by providing -DFORCE_PACKING at compile time, this
will save memory. Might not be suitable for some architectures.
* Fixed 'Ray: code/MessageProcessor.cpp:1317: void
MessageProcessor::call_RAY_MPI_TAG_GET_PATH_LENGTH(Message*): Assertion
`m_fusionData->m_FUSION_identifier_map.count(id)>0' failed.' This occured when
vertices of a path are involved with fusions, but the associated path was not
stored owing too its length that was too short.
* Grouped messages for read indexing.
* The maximum coverage allowed is not 65535 instead of 255.
* Sequencing indexing in the de Bruijn graph places each read on a 'good'
vertex.
* Included algorithm for repeats traversal using large outer distance


= 1.2.3 'cRAYfish' =
2011-02-05

* Instruction manual
* Fixed a bug leading to a segmentation fault when providing an invalid file
or no file at all. This bug was introduced in Ray 1.2.2.
* Fixed a bug leading to a hang when providing invalid arguments.
* Added reporting of memory usage after loading sequences and after
distributing vertices.
* Removed read simulators because samtools include one called 'wgsim'.
* Changed the paired-end heuristics to accomodate larger distances.
* Removed RepeatedVertexWatchdog.
* Changed the RepeatedThreshold from 255 to 2*peakCoverage (or 255 if it is
higher than 255)
* Now both versions of read pairs are utilized.
* Paired reads are utilized if the distance falls in mean-3 standard
deviation;mean+3 standard deviation. (3 instead of 1 as described in the
paper).
* If a pair of reads does not respect the constraints, the right read is 
removed from the used read set.
* Fusions are computed more cautiously.
* Added reporting of memory usage for sequence reads and for vertices. And for
a few other places too.
* Improved memory usage for the extensions. Now calling destructors instead of
clear() because the latter does not free memory.
* Messages are grouped in the computation of seeds, using VirtualCommunicator.
* Added a Doxygen configuration file.
* The paths in the distributed graph are now numbered with an integer of 64
bits. This fixes a segmentation fault occuring with large genomes -- when
identifiers overflow on 32 bits. (need to verify this)
* The partition on sequence reads is outputted.
* Instead of having the Rank 0 (master) to request the contigs of each every
other rank, now each rank appends its fusions to the contigs file and also to
the AMOS file.
* Fixed a bug in the numbering of reads in the AMOS file.
* Fixed a memory usage problem in the memory consumption reducer
* Improved the running time for the extension of seeds by removing an inner
loop.


= 1.2.2 'X-ray' =
2011-01-11

* The number of messages in the inbox of any MPI rank is always 0 or 1.
* The number of messages in the outbox of any MPI rank is always lower than or
equal to max(17,number of MPI ranks).
* Fixed a ring buffer overflow when requesting the reads starting on a
highly-repetitive vertex.
* Implemented a chunk allocator for the arrays of sequencing reads locally
stored on compute nodes.
* Parallel reading of sequence files.
* Some improvements on the experimental memory consumption reducer.
* Sequence reads are now encoded: each nucleotide is stored with 2 bits
instead of 8 bits.
* Fixed bugs when there are more than 4294967296 (2^32) sequence reads in
total, the maximum now is 18446744073709551616 (2^64).


= 1.2.1 'stringray' =
2010-12-30

* SplayTreeIterator now iterates in preorder instead of inorder.
* Now the SplayTreeIterator is utilized to iterate over the vertices instead of
storing them in an array (takes too much memory).
* The forest of splay trees now contains 16384 trees instead of 4096. Note
that as usual, each MPI rank has its own forest. Furthermore, the forest freezes when vertices distribution is properly
finished -- which means no more splaying in the splay trees is to occur. The process
ensures that vertices with low redundancy remain at leaves.
* Bubble traversal ensures no misassemblies as
polymorphic positions (substitution, and indels) are assembled !!!
* Works with 454 data too (454 homopolymers error are interpreted as
polymorphic positions).
* Added numeric indicator for files. (example: [1/9])
* Corrected a bug in library lengths messaging that leaded to hanging and/or
Bus Error.
* Fixed a segmentation fault when the -a (output AMOS) is provided. Thanks to
Daniel Brami from J. Craig Venter Institute (La Jolla, CA) for the timely
report.
* Preliminary version of an algorithm to preemptively reduce the memory usage
while building the distributed graph.
* Under GNU/Linux platforms, Ray outputs the virtual memory (VmData from
/proc, that is the heap) utilized before exiting.


= 1.2.0 =
2010-12-03

* Implemented lazy loading of files (sequences in any files are loaded in
small batches instead of loading the whole file.)
* Added an error message for an invalid extension. Thanks to Jean-Francois
Pombert (University of British Columbia) for the feature request.
* Removed comparison scripts -- if you want them, download a previous version.
* Fixed configure script.
* Added ArrayOfReads, a dynamic array that free its memory on clearing. (unline vector in stl, apparently.)
* Fixed a division by zero. (in BufferedData.cpp)
* Reduced the computation time of 'Finishing fusions' from 5+ hours to 3 minutes or so for 
the chromosome 1 of the human genome, simulated with two libraries: 200 & 400. In v. 1.0.0, many messages were unecessary for this
step in the algorithm.
* Now the approximation of fragment lengths for libraries is deterministic, no matter the order of the files
and the number of MPI ranks.
* Added two useful scripts to check resources on supercomputers with Sun Grid Engine: qhost.py and add-color-to-qhost.py.
-> qhost.py 1072283|add-color-to-qhost.py > Ray.html
* Added makefile.alternate to compile Ray if the configure script fails.
'make -f makefile.alternate'
* Added an fflush call after calls to printf to have a beautiful output in stdout with MPICH2.
* Removed DistributionData.
* PairedRead now contains m_readIndex (u32), m_rank (u16) and m_library (u8)
instead of m_readIndex (u32), m_rank (u16), m_fragmentSize (u16) and
m_deviation (u16). That means storing one paired read needs 7 bytes instead of
10 bytes. Library information are stored in Parameters.
* 'make install' also installs documentation and examples now.
* Moved finishFusion & makeFusion in FusionData.cpp
* Moved seed creation in SeedingData.cpp
* Now print-latex.sh, the script that calculates metrics for an assembly, uses
only MUMmer and AMOS commands (no more BLAST).

= 1.0.0 =
2010-11-25

* Made a lots of changes to make Ray compliant with the standard MPI 2.2
* Added master and slave modes.
* Added an array of master methods (pointers): selecting the master method
with the master mode is done in O(1).

with the master mode is done in O(1).
* Added an array of message handlers (pointers): selecting the message handler method
with the message tag is done in O(1).

* Regulated the communication in the MPI 'tribe'.
* Added an assertion to verify the message buffer length before sending it.
* Modified bits so that if a message is more than 4096 bytes, split it in
chunks.
* Used a sentinel to remove two messages, coupled with TAG_REQUEST_READS.
* Stress-tested with MPICH2.
* Implemented a ring allocator for inboxes and outboxes.
* Changed flushing so that all use <flush> & <flushAll> in BufferedData.
* Changed the maximum message size from 4096 to 4000 to send messages eagerly
more often (if it happens). Thanks to Open-MPI developpers for their
support and explanation on the eagerness of Open-MPI: Eugene Loh (Oracle), George Bosilca
(University of Tennessee), Jeff Squyres (Cisco).
* Changed the way sequencing reads are indexed: before the master was
reloading (again !) files to do so, now no files are loaded and every MPI ranks
participate in the task.
* Modified the way sequences are distributed. These are now appended to fill the buffer, and
the sentinel called 'End of transmission' is used. Thanks to
Élénie Godzaridis for pointing out that '\0' is not a valid sentinel for
strings !
* Optimized the flushing in BufferedData: flush is now destination-specific.
O(1) instead of O(n) where n is the number of MPI ranks.
* Optimized the extension: paired information is appended in the buffer in
which the sequence itself is.
* Added support for .fasta.bz2 & .fastq.bz2. This needs LIBBZ2 (-lbz2)
* Added instructions in the INSTALL file for manually compiling the source in
case the configure script gets tricky (cat INSTALL).
* Added a received messages file. This is pretty useless unless you want to
see if the received messages are uniform !.
* Added bits to write the fragment length distribution of each library.
* Changed the definition of MPI tags: they are now defined with a enum.
Thanks to Élénie Godzaridis for the suggestion.
* Changed the definition of slave modes: they are now defined with a enum.
Thanks to Élénie Godzaridis for the suggestion.

* Designed a beautiful logo with Inkscape.
* Added a script for regression tests. 
* Changed bits so that a paired read is not updated if it does not need it
* Changed the meaning of the -o parameter: it is now a prefix.
* Added examples with MPICH2, Open-MPI, and Open-MPI/SunGridEngine.
* Changed DEBUG for ASSERT as it activates assertions.
* Updated the citation in the standard output.
* Corrected the interleave-fastq python script.
* Changed the license file from LICENSE to COPYING.
* Removed the trimming of reads if they are not read from a file.
* Increased the verbosity of the extension step.
* Added gnuplot scripts.
* Changed the file name for changes: from NEWS to ChangeLog.
