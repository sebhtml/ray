DESCRIPTION:

  The Ray genome assembler is built on top of the RayPlatform, a generic plugin-based
  distributed and parallel compute engine that uses the message-passing interface
  for passing messages.

  Ray targets several applications:

    - de novo genome assembly (with Ray vanilla)
    - de novo meta-genome assembly (with Ray Méta)
    - de novo transcriptome assembly (works, but not tested a lot)
    - quantification of contig abundances
    - quantification of microbiome consortia members (with Ray Communities)
    - quantification of transcript expression
    - taxonomy profiling of samples (with Ray Communities)
    - gene ontology profiling of samples (with Ray Ontologies)

    - compare DNA samples using words (Ray -run-surveyor ...; see Ray Surveyor options)

       -help
              Displays this help page.

       -version
              Displays Ray version and compilation options.

  Run Ray in pure MPI mode

    mpiexec -n 80 Ray ...

  Run Ray with mini-ranks on 10 machines, 8 cores / machine (MPI and IEEE POSIX threads)

    mpiexec -n 10 Ray -mini-ranks-per-rank 7 ...

  Run Ray on one core only (still needs MPI)

    Ray ...


  Using a configuration file

    Ray can be launched with
    mpiexec -n 16 Ray Ray.conf
    The configuration file can include comments (starting with #).

  K-mer length

       -k kmerLength
              Selects the length of k-mers. The default value is 21. 
              It must be odd because reverse-complement vertices are stored together.
              The maximum length is defined at compilation by CONFIG_MAXKMERLENGTH
              Larger k-mers utilise more memory.

  Inputs

       -detect-sequence-files SampleDirectory
              Detects files in a directory automatically.
              This option can generate these commands automatically for you: LoadPairedEndReads (-p) and LoadSingleEndReads (-s)

       -p leftSequenceFile rightSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides two files containing paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.
              LoadPairedEndReads is equivalent to -p

       -i interleavedSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides one file containing interleaved paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -s sequenceFile
              Provides a file containing single-end reads.
              LoadSingleEndReads is equivalent to -s

  Outputs

       -o outputDirectory
              Specifies the directory for outputted files. Default is RayOutput
              Other name: -output

  Ray Surveyor options

       -run-surveyor
              Runs Ray Surveyor to compare samples.
              See Documentation/Ray-Surveyor.md
              This workflow generates:
              RayOutput/Surveyor/SimilarityMatrix.tsv is a similarity Gramian matrix based on shared DNA words
              RayOutput/Surveyor/DistanceMatrix.tsv is a distance matrix (kernel-based).
       -read-sample-graph SampleName SampleGraphFile
              Reads a sample graph (generated with -write-kmers)

  Assembly options (defaults work well)

       -disable-recycling
              Disables read recycling during the assembly
              reads will be set free in 3 cases:
              1. the distance did not match for a pair
              2. the read has not met its mate
              3. the library population indicates a wrong placement
              see Constrained traversal of repeats with paired sequences.

              Disables the scaffolder.

              Runs in color-space
              Needs csfasta files. Activated automatically if csfasta files are provided.

       -use-maximum-seed-coverage maximumSeedCoverageDepth
              Ignores any seed with a coverage depth above this threshold.
              The default is 4294967295.

       -use-minimum-seed-coverage minimumSeedCoverageDepth
              Sets the minimum seed coverage depth.
              Any path with a coverage depth lower than this will be discarded. The default is 0.

       -bloom-filter-bits bits
              Sets the number of bits for the Bloom filter
              Default is auto bits (adaptive), 0 bits disables the Bloom filter.

       -one-color-per-file
              Sets one color per file instead of one per sequence.
              By default, each sequence in each file has a different color.
              For files with large numbers of sequences, using one single color per file may be more efficient.

  Message routing for large number of cores

       -route-messages
              Enables the Ray message router. Disabled by default.
              Messages will be routed accordingly so that any rank can communicate directly with only a few others.
              Without -route-messages, any rank can communicate directly with any other rank.
              Files generated: Routing/Connections.txt, Routing/Routes.txt and Routing/RelayEvents.txt
              and Routing/Summary.txt

       -connection-type type
              Sets the connection type for routes.
              Accepted values are debruijn, hypercube, polytope, group, random, kautz and complete. Default is debruijn.
               torus: a k-ary n-cube, radix: k, dimension: n, degree: 2*dimension, vertices: radix^dimension
               polytope: a convex regular polytope, alphabet is {0,1,...,B-1} and the vertices is a power of B
               hypercube: a hypercube, alphabet is {0,1} and the vertices is a power of 2
               debruijn: a full de Bruijn graph a given alphabet and diameter
               kautz: a full de Kautz graph, which is a subgraph of a de Bruijn graph
               group: silly model where one representative per group can communicate with outsiders
               random: Erdős–Rényi model
               complete: a full graph with all the possible connections
              With the type debruijn, the number of ranks must be a power of something.
              Examples: 256 = 16*16, 512=8*8*8, 49=7*7, and so on.
              Otherwise, don't use debruijn routing but use another one
              With the type kautz, the number of ranks n must be n=(k+1)*k^(d-1) for some k and d

       -routing-graph-degree degree
              Specifies the outgoing degree for the routing graph.
