NAME
       Ray - assemble genomes in parallel using the message-passing interface

SYNOPSIS
       mpiexec -n NUMBER_OF_RANKS Ray -k KMERLENGTH -p l1_1.fastq l1_2.fastq -p l2_1.fastq l2_2.fastq -o test

       mpiexec -n NUMBER_OF_RANKS Ray Ray.conf # with commands in a file

DESCRIPTION:

  The Ray genome assembler is built on top of the RayPlatform, a generic plugin-based
  distributed and parallel compute engine that uses the message-passing interface
  for passing messages.

  Ray targets several applications:

    - de novo genome assembly (with Ray vanilla)
    - de novo meta-genome assembly (with Ray Méta)
    - de novo transcriptome assembly (works, but not tested a lot)
    - quantification of contig abundances
    - quantification of microbiome consortia members (with Ray Communities)
    - quantification of transcript expression
    - taxonomy profiling of samples (with Ray Communities)
    - gene ontology profiling of samples (with Ray Ontologies)

       -help
              Displays this help page.

       -version
              Displays Ray version and compilation options.

  Using a configuration file

    Ray can be launched with
    mpiexec -n 16 Ray Ray.conf
    The configuration file can include comments (starting with #).

  K-mer length

       -k kmerLength
              Selects the length of k-mers. The default value is 21. 
              It must be odd because reverse-complement vertices are stored together.
              The maximum length is defined at compilation by MAXKMERLENGTH
              Larger k-mers utilise more memory.

  Inputs

       -p leftSequenceFile rightSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides two files containing paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -i interleavedSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides one file containing interleaved paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -s sequenceFile
              Provides a file containing single-end reads.

  Outputs

       -o outputDirectory
              Specifies the directory for outputted files. Default is RayOutput

  Assembly options (defaults work well)

       -disable-recycling
              Disables read recycling during the assembly
              reads will be set free in 3 cases:
              1. the distance did not match for a pair
              2. the read has not met its mate
              3. the library population indicates a wrong placement
              see Constrained traversal of repeats with paired sequences.

              Disables the scaffolder.

       -minimum-contig-length minimumContigLength
              Changes the minimum contig length, default is 100 nucleotides

       -color-space
              Runs in color-space
              Needs csfasta files. Activated automatically if csfasta files are provided.

       -use-maximum-seed-coverage maximumSeedCoverageDepth
              Ignores any seed with a coverage depth above this threshold.
              The default is 4294967295.

              Sets the minimum seed coverage depth.
              Any path with a coverage depth lower than this will be discarded. The default is 0.

  Distributed storage engine (all these values are for each MPI rank)

       -bloom-filter-bits bits
              Sets the number of bits for the Bloom filter
              Default is 268435456 bits, 0 bits disables the Bloom filter.

       -hash-table-buckets buckets
              Sets the initial number of buckets. Must be a power of 2 !
              Default value: 268435456

       -hash-table-buckets-per-group buckets

       -one-color-per-file
              Sets one color per file instead of one per sequence.
              By default, each sequence in each file has a different color.
              For files with large numbers of sequences, using one single color per file may be more efficient.

  Message routing for large number of cores

       -route-messages
              Enables the Ray message router. Disabled by default.
              Messages will be routed accordingly so that any rank can communicate directly with only a few others.
              Without -route-messages, any rank can communicate directly with any other rank.
              Files generated: Routing/Connections.txt, Routing/Routes.txt and Routing/RelayEvents.txt
              and Routing/Summary.txt

       -connection-type type
              Sets the connection type for routes.
              Accepted values are debruijn, hypercube, polytope, group, random, kautz and complete. Default is debruijn.
               debruijn: a full de Bruijn graph a given alphabet and diameter
               hypercube: a hypercube, alphabet is {0,1} and the vertices is a power of 2
               polytope: a convex regular polytope, alphabet is {0,1,...,B-1} and the vertices is a power of B
               group: silly model where one representative per group can communicate with outsiders
               random: Erdős–Rényi model
               kautz: a full de Kautz graph, which is a subgraph of a de Bruijn graph
               complete: a full graph with all the possible connections
              With the type debruijn, the number of ranks must be a power of something.
              Examples: 256 = 16*16, 512=8*8*8, 49=7*7, and so on.
              Otherwise, don't use debruijn routing but use another one
              With the type kautz, the number of ranks n must be n=(k+1)*k^(d-1) for some k and d

       -routing-graph-degree degree
              Specifies the outgoing degree for the routing graph.

       -run-profiler
              Runs the profiler as the code runs. By default, only show granularity warnings.
              Running the profiler increases running times.

       -with-profiler-details
              Shows number of messages sent and received in each methods during in each time slices (epochs). Needs -run-profiler.
