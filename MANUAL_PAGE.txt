       mpiexec -np NUMBER_OF_RANKS Ray -k KMERLENGTH -p l1_1.fastq l1_2.fastq -p l2_1.fastq l2_2.fastq -o test

DESCRIPTION:

       -help
              Displays this help page.

       -version
              Displays Ray version and compilation options.

  K-mer length

       -k kmerLength
              Selects the length of k-mers. The default value is 21. 
              It must be odd because reverse-complement vertices are stored together.
              The maximum length is defined at compilation by MAXKMERLENGTH
              Larger k-mers utilise more memory.

  Inputs

       -p leftSequenceFile rightSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides two files containing paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -i interleavedSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides one file containing interleaved paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -s sequenceFile
              Provides a file containing single-end reads.

  Outputs

       -o outputDirectory

              An AMOS file contains read positions on contigs.
              Can be opened with software with graphical user interface.

       -write-kmers
              Writes k-mer graph to RayOutput/kmers.txt
              The resulting file is not utilised by Ray.

              Writes marker statistics.

  Memory usage

       -show-memory-usage
              Shows memory usage. Data is fetched from /proc on GNU/Linux
              Needs __linux__

              Shows memory allocation events

  Algorithm verbosity

       -show-extension-choice
              Shows the choice made (with other choices) during the extension.

       -show-ending-context
              Shows the ending context of each extension.
              Shows the children of the vertex where extension was too difficult.

              Shows summary of outer distances used for an extension path.

       -show-consensus
              Shows the consensus when a choice is done.

  Assembly options (defaults work well)

       -color-space
              Runs in color-space
              Needs csfasta files. Activated automatically if csfasta files are provided.

       -minimumCoverage minimumCoverage
              Sets manually the minimum coverage.
              If not provided, it is computed by Ray automatically.

       -peakCoverage peakCoverage
              Sets manually the peak coverage.
              If not provided, it is computed by Ray automatically.

       -repeatCoverage repeatCoverage
              Sets manually the repeat coverage.
              If not provided, it is computed by Ray automatically.

  Checkpointing

       -write-checkpoints
              Write checkpoint files

       -read-checkpoints
              Read checkpoint files

       -read-write-checkpoints
              Read and write checkpoint files

  Message routing for large number of cores

       -route-messages
              Enables the Ray message router. Disabled by default.
              Messages will be routed accordingly so that any rank can communicate directly with only a few others.
              Without -route-messages, any rank can communicate directly with any other rank.
              Files generated: Routing.Connections.txt, Routing.Routes.txt and Routing.RelayEvents.txt
              and Routing.Summary.txt

       -connection-type type
              Sets the connection type for routes.
              Accepted values are debruijn, group, random, kautz and complete. Default is debruijn.
              With the type debruijn, the number of ranks must be a power of something.
              Examples: 256 = 16*16, 512=8*8*8, 49=7*7, and so on.
              Otherwise, don't use debruijn routing but use another one
              With the type kautz, the number of ranks n must be n=(k+1)*k^(d-1) for some k and d

       -routing-graph-degree degree
              Specifies the outgoing degree for the routing graph.

              Tests the network and returns.

       -write-network-test-raw-data
              Writes one additional file per rank detailing the network test.

  Debugging

       -run-profiler
              Runs the profiler as the code runs. By default, only show granularity warnings.
              Running the profiler increases running times.

       -with-profiler-details
              Shows number of messages sent and received in each methods during in each time slices (epochs). Needs -run-profiler.

       -show-communication-events
              Shows all messages sent and received.

              Bubbles can be due to heterozygous sites or sequencing errors or other (unknown) events

       -debug-seeds
              Debugs seed code.
              Seeds are paths in the graph that are likely unique.
